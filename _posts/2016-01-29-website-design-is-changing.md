# Website Design is changing

I have been working with website design and graphics since around 2006\. Two years later I took this interest to the next level and went back to school after almost 30 years. This renewed interest in web development has grown into a passion that is constantly changing. 

Watching how the web has evolved, proliferation of the mobile device, Web 2.0/3.0, responsive design, open source content management systems, editing websites within the browser, do-it-yourself systems....the list goes on.

When I first heard about the Grid I knew that it was something I needed to be involved in, wrap my head around and understand how it worked and what it's potential was. As you may notice, this website is running on top of the Grid. 

What is the Grid? It is the first Artificial Intelligence (AI) web platform that shifts and moves content around for you without you worrying about how it will fit or what it will look like on a particular device. The Grid takes colours from your photos and incorporates those colours into your website automagically. 

This is an interesting time to be on the web or a part of developing for it.
